# blotGL

Just messing around with braille rendering using shaders...

I was inspired by [The Cherno](https://github.com/TheCherno)'s [C++ Application Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUxZ5N77M5E) video.

See also my other project [blot](https://github.com/bartman/blot/) that can graph data using braille on the terminal.
